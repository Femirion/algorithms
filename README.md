I decided to refresh my skills in Structures, Algorithms and etc.

I am using "Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne" for it.

Some rules:
1) If yoy pay attention for any code in that repository I will happy
2) If you have any question you able to create issue.
3) If you want to improve my code you able to create pull-request.
